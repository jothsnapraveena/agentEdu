# Agentic AI: A 6-Week Course for High Schoolers
### A Free Curriculum by AgentEdu · Created by Jothsna Praveena Pendyala

---

**Course Description**
This 6-week course introduces high school students to agentic AI — systems that can reason, plan, use tools, and adapt to achieve goals. Students progress from understanding what an AI agent is, to building and demoing their own working agent using free no-code tools. No prior coding experience required.

**Target Audience:** Grades 9–12 · AP CS Principles · Introduction to AI · Elective tech courses  
**Time Commitment:** ~60–90 minutes per week  
**Prerequisites:** None. Curiosity required.  
**Standards Alignment:** CSTA K-12 CS Standards · AI4K12 Big Ideas 1, 3, 4 · ISTE Student Standards  

---

## How to Use This Curriculum

Each week includes:
- **Learning objectives** — what students will be able to do
- **Key concepts** — terms and ideas to cover
- **Lesson outline** — timing guide for a 75-minute class
- **Discussion questions** — open-ended prompts for class conversation
- **Student activity** — hands-on assignment (worksheet or project)
- **Teacher notes** — facilitation tips and common student questions

Weeks 1–4 are concept-building. Week 5 is full hands-on build. Week 6 is reflection and future-thinking. You can run all 6 weeks or pick individual weeks as standalone modules.

**Two threads run through every week:**
- **A Responsible-AI thread** — each week has a short beat on accountability, harm, oversight, or ethics. It starts with "Who owns this agent's decisions?" in Week 1 and pays off at Demo Day in Week 5, so students learn to *govern* agents, not just build them.
- **A Portfolio thread** — each week produces one artifact. Collected together (see the **Portfolio Tracker** and `portfolio.html`), they become a college-application-ready piece.

See the **Equity & Access** section for no-login, offline, and 45-minute versions of every activity.

## Week 1 — What Is an AI Agent?

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Define an AI agent and distinguish it from a simple AI tool
- Identify the three stages of the agent reasoning loop: Think → Act → Observe
- Give 3 real-world examples of AI agents and explain what makes them "agentic"

### Key Concepts
| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| AI Agent | A software system that perceives its environment, reasons about a goal, takes actions, and adapts based on feedback |
| Agentic AI | AI that has autonomy — it can plan and act without a human directing every step |
| The Reasoning Loop | Think (reason about the goal) → Act (do something) → Observe (see what happened) → repeat |
| LLM | Large Language Model — the "brain" that powers modern AI agents |
| Prompt | The instructions or question given to an AI |

### Lesson Outline (75 min)
- **0:00–0:10** — Hook: Show a 2-minute demo of a real AI agent (suggested: a coding assistant solving a bug, or a research agent finding information). Ask: "What did the AI just do that a basic chatbot couldn't?"
- **0:10–0:25** — Lecture: What makes AI "agentic"? The Think → Act → Observe loop explained with a simple diagram. Compare: calculator (not agentic) vs. AI research assistant (agentic).
- **0:25–0:40** — Group exploration: Show 3 real-world agents (customer service bot, coding assistant, content writer). Small groups identify what tools each agent uses and when it makes decisions.
- **0:40–0:65** — Student Activity (below)
- **0:65–0:75** — Share-out and wrap-up

### Discussion Questions
1. What's the difference between asking ChatGPT a question and giving an AI agent a task to complete on your behalf?
2. What would have to be true for an AI agent to be trustworthy enough to act without asking you first?
3. Can you think of a situation where an AI agent acting autonomously could go wrong?

### Responsible-AI Beat — "Who Owns This Agent's Decisions?" (5 min)
Run this as a short closing discussion *after* students have seen real agents — it lands better once they have concrete examples in mind than as an opener. Pose one question:

> **When an AI agent makes a decision and it turns out to be wrong — who is responsible?** The person who built it? The person who used it? The company that sold it? The agent itself?

There's no clean answer, and that's the point. Every agent decision traces back to a human who is accountable for it. This is the first thread of a "responsible AI" mindset that runs through all six weeks (it returns at Demo Day in Week 5). Keep it to 5 minutes — you're planting the question, not resolving it.

**Plain-language data note for students:** the apps you mapped above collect data about *you* to make their decisions, and you have a say in that.

### Student Activity — The Agent Hunt
Students choose a technology they use regularly (a recommendation engine, a voice assistant, an autocomplete tool, etc.) and fill in the Agent Profile worksheet:

```
Agent Name: _______________
What goal does it pursue? _______________
THINK: What does it reason about? _______________
ACT: What action does it take? _______________
OBSERVE: How does it learn from what happened? _______________
Is it fully autonomous or does a human stay in the loop? _______________
One way it could fail or make a mistake: _______________
```

### Teacher Notes
- Students often conflate "AI agent" with "chatbot." Emphasize that the key differentiator is autonomy — agents take sequences of actions to reach a goal, not just answer one question.
- If students struggle to identify agents, prompt: "Does it keep doing things after the first response, or does it stop?"
- **FERPA / student-data note:** Before any week where students put information into an AI tool, remember that student records are protected under FERPA. Have students use *non-identifying* example data (a made-up persona, a public document) rather than real names, grades, or personal records. Check whether a tool is on your district's approved list before requiring accounts. See the **Equity & Access** section near the end of this guide for no-login and offline alternatives.

## Week 2 — The Brain Behind the Agent

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain how a Large Language Model works at a conceptual level (next-token prediction)
- Write an effective prompt using at least 3 prompting techniques
- Identify when an AI response is confidently wrong (hallucination) and explain why it happens

### Key Concepts
| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Large Language Model (LLM) | A neural network trained on vast text data to predict what words come next |
| Token | The basic unit an LLM processes — roughly a word or part of a word |
| Hallucination | When an AI confidently states something false because it generates plausible-sounding text, not factual text |
| Chain-of-thought | Prompting an AI to "think step by step" before answering, which improves accuracy |
| System prompt | Background instructions given to an AI before the user interacts with it |
| Zero-shot vs few-shot | Zero-shot: no examples given. Few-shot: examples included in the prompt to guide the response. |

### Lesson Outline (75 min)
- **0:00–0:10** — Hook: Ask an AI a question it gets confidently wrong (try a recent event or a trick math problem). Discuss: why did it fail?
- **0:10–0:30** — Lecture: How LLMs work — explain next-token prediction with a simple analogy (autocomplete on your phone, scaled to billions of parameters). Why hallucination is a structural problem, not a bug.
- **0:30–0:50** — Live demo and practice: Show the difference between a vague prompt and a well-structured one. Introduce 4 techniques: (1) role assignment, (2) step-by-step instruction, (3) output format specification, (4) few-shot examples.
- **0:50–0:70** — Student Activity (below)
- **0:70–0:75** — Reflection and debrief

### Discussion Questions
1. If an LLM is essentially "predicting the next word," why does it seem to understand what we mean?
2. How is hallucination different from a human making a mistake? Is it more dangerous, or less?
3. If you were building an AI agent for something important (medical advice, legal documents), what safeguards would you add?

### Responsible-AI Beat — Hallucination vs. Misinformation (10 min)
Students already learn *why* AI hallucinates above. This beat adds the question that actually matters in the real world: **when is AI being wrong merely annoying, and when is it harmful?**

Draw a simple 2×2 on the board: **Wrong / Right** on one axis, **Low-stakes / High-stakes** on the other.

- A **hallucination** is when the AI is confidently *wrong*. (A mechanism.)
- **Misinformation** is when a wrong answer *causes harm* because someone acts on it. (An outcome.)

The same hallucination is harmless in one square and dangerous in another: "the AI invented a fake fun-fact for my essay opener" vs. "the AI invented a fake medication dosage and someone followed it." The lesson for students: **the responsibility isn't just to notice AI is wrong — it's to fact-check *before acting*, especially when the stakes are high.**

Quick activity (do it live): take one confidently-wrong AI answer and have students place it in the right square, then name what they'd verify before acting on it and *how* (a primary source, a second tool, a human expert).

### Student Activity — The Prompt Engineering Challenge
Students compete to get the best output from an AI using only prompt engineering (no code). Three rounds:

**Round 1 — The Explainer:** Get the AI to explain quantum computing to a 10-year-old in exactly 5 sentences.  
**Round 2 — The Debugger:** Paste a broken piece of simple code. Get the AI to find the bug and explain why it's wrong.  
**Round 3 — The Planner:** Get the AI to create a complete study plan for an upcoming exam, including specific time blocks.

Students compare outputs and vote on the best prompt for each round. Debrief: what made the winning prompts work?

### Teacher Notes
- LLM mechanics can be simplified: "It's an extremely sophisticated autocomplete that learned patterns from most of the internet. It generates what sounds right — which is usually correct, but not always."
- Hallucination is a great teachable moment: AI is not a search engine. It generates, not retrieves.

---

## Week 3 — Tools & Memory

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain why an LLM alone is limited and what tools add to agent capability
- Distinguish between short-term (in-context) and long-term (persistent) memory
- Describe at a high level how RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) works

### Key Concepts
| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Tool calling | The ability of an AI agent to invoke an external function (search, calculator, code runner, database query) and use the result in its response |
| Context window | The amount of text an LLM can "see" at once — its short-term working memory |
| RAG | Retrieval-Augmented Generation — fetching relevant documents and giving them to the LLM so it answers from real information, not just training data |
| Vector database | A specialized database that stores information as mathematical representations (embeddings), enabling similarity-based retrieval |
| Persistent memory | Information stored outside the LLM and retrieved across multiple conversations |

### Lesson Outline (75 min)
- **0:00–0:10** — Hook: Ask an AI agent what happened in the news yesterday. Watch it fail or make things up. Then show it using a web search tool to answer correctly. Discussion: what changed?
- **0:10–0:30** — Lecture: The limitations of a bare LLM (no real-time data, no persistent memory, no ability to compute). How tools solve each limitation. Introduction to the tool-calling loop.
- **0:30–0:45** — Concept: RAG explained with a physical analogy. "Imagine taking an open-book test — RAG is giving the AI the right pages from the textbook before it answers."
- **0:45–0:70** — Student Activity (below)
- **0:70–0:75** — Debrief

### Discussion Questions
1. What kinds of tasks would you NOT trust an AI agent without tools to do? What about with tools?
2. If an AI can search the internet in real time, does that solve the hallucination problem? Why or why not?
3. What personal information would you be comfortable storing in an AI's long-term memory about you? Where's your limit?

### Student Activity — Part A: See RAG Work (no code)
RAG is a learning objective this week, so students should *experience retrieval*, not just hear the analogy. Using a free no-code RAG tool, students ground an AI in a document and watch it answer from that source:

**Tool options (pick one):**
- **NotebookLM** (notebooklm.google.com) — upload sources, ask questions, get answers *with citations back to the source*. The citations make retrieval visible, which is the whole point.
- **Perplexity** (perplexity.ai) — ask a question and watch it cite the web pages it retrieved before answering.

**Steps:**
1. Feed in a document everyone shares — the **school handbook**, a class syllabus, or a public article. (Use a *public/non-identifying* document — see the FERPA note.)
2. Ask 3 questions the document answers (e.g., "What's the attendance policy?") and 1 question it does **not** answer.
3. Observe: for the answerable questions, where did the answer come from? For the unanswerable one, did the tool say "not in the source," or did it make something up?

Document: *Which answers were grounded in the source vs. invented? How did seeing the citation change your trust in the answer?* This is the difference between an AI that **retrieves** and one that only **generates** — the core idea of RAG.

### Student Activity — Part B: Build a Memory Bot (optional / if time)
Using a free no-code platform (e.g., Claude.ai, ChatGPT with memory, or Zapier AI), students:
1. Start a conversation about a topic they care about (a hobby, a sports team, a show)
2. Give the AI specific facts to remember (their preferences, opinions, background)
3. End the conversation, start a new one
4. Test: does the AI remember what it was told?

Then students document: What did it remember? What did it forget? What would make this more useful in a real product?

### Teacher Notes
- RAG is the most practically important concept in this week. The analogy of "open-book test" lands well with students — but Part A lets them *see* the open book, which is far stickier than the analogy alone.
- NotebookLM is ideal here because every answer links back to the exact source passage. When students see "the AI pulled this from page 4," retrieval stops being abstract.
- Context window limits are easy to demonstrate live: paste a very long document and ask the AI about the beginning after it has processed the end.
- **Access note:** If your district blocks these tools or student logins, see the **Equity & Access** section for a teacher-projected version and an unplugged paper-RAG alternative.

## Week 4 — Multi-Agent Systems

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain why multi-agent systems exist and when a single agent is insufficient
- Distinguish between an orchestrator agent and a worker agent
- Design a simple multi-agent pipeline for a specific task

### Key Concepts
| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Multi-agent system | A network of AI agents that collaborate to complete complex tasks |
| Orchestrator | The "manager" agent that breaks down a task and assigns subtasks to other agents |
| Worker/specialist agent | An agent with a specific skill (coding, writing, research, verification) |
| Handoff | The passing of information or control from one agent to another |
| Guardrails | Rules or checks that prevent an agent from taking harmful or unauthorized actions |
| Human-in-the-loop | A design pattern where humans review or approve agent actions before they execute |

### Lesson Outline (75 min)
- **0:00–0:10** — Hook: "Why do companies have departments instead of one all-knowing employee?" Draw the parallel to AI agent teams.
- **0:10–0:30** — Lecture: Real enterprise multi-agent examples. Show a diagram of how a research pipeline works: Orchestrator → Research Agent → Summarization Agent → Fact-Check Agent → Delivery Agent.
- **0:30–0:50** — Discussion: What can go wrong when agents hand off to each other? What happens when one agent makes an error that compounds through the chain?
- **0:50–0:70** — Student Activity (below)
- **0:70–0:75** — Gallery walk and debrief

### Discussion Questions
1. If you had a team of AI agents doing your homework, what would you want each one to specialize in?
2. How do you know which agent to trust if they disagree with each other?
3. At what point does a multi-agent system become too autonomous to be safe?

### Student Activity — Design Your Agent Team
Students work in pairs to design a multi-agent system for a scenario of their choice from this list:
- A homework helper that researches, writes, and checks for plagiarism
- A travel planner that researches, books, and sends confirmation emails
- A sports analyst that watches game data and writes weekly reports

For their chosen scenario, students fill out:
```
Task: _______________
Orchestrator Agent (its job): _______________
Worker Agent 1 (specialty + what it receives/produces): _______________
Worker Agent 2 (specialty + what it receives/produces): _______________
Worker Agent 3 (specialty + what it receives/produces): _______________
Where does a human need to stay in the loop? _______________
What's the biggest risk if something goes wrong? _______________
```

### Oversight-by-Design Add — Annotate Your Approval Checkpoints
After pairs draw their pipeline (Orchestrator → Worker → Worker → …), give them one more task: **draw a 🛑 stop sign on the diagram everywhere a human must approve before the agent continues.** A checkpoint is required before any action that is *irreversible or affects someone else* — sending an email, spending money, publishing content, submitting a form, sharing personal data.

For each 🛑 they place, they answer:
```
Checkpoint at: _______________ (which handoff / action)
Why a human must approve here: _______________
What the human is checking for: _______________
```

This turns "human-in-the-loop" from a vocabulary word into a design decision. The lesson: **good agent systems decide where humans approve *before* they're built, not after something goes wrong.**

### Teacher Notes
- Students find the "team analogy" very intuitive. Push them to think about failure modes — what happens when one agent produces bad output that the next agent uses without checking?
- Human-in-the-loop is worth emphasizing: most production systems have at least one human checkpoint before irreversible actions (sending emails, making purchases, publishing content).
- A useful litmus test for students placing 🛑 checkpoints: "If the agent gets this step wrong, can you undo it?" If no, a human belongs in the loop there.

## Week 5 — Build Your First Agent

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Use a no-code agent builder to create a functional AI agent
- Test their agent, identify failure modes, and iterate
- Present and demo their agent to peers

### Tools (all free, no account required for basic use)
- **Claude.ai** — for conversational agent building with tools enabled
- **ChatGPT with custom instructions + browsing** — for web-connected agents
- **Zapier AI Agents** — for connecting agents to real workflows
- **Make.com** — for multi-step automation with AI nodes
- Optional for advanced students: **Flowise** (open-source, visual LangChain builder)

### Lesson Outline (75 min)
- **0:00–0:10** — Introduction to the build challenge and tool walkthrough
- **0:10–0:20** — Demo: Teacher builds a simple research agent live in 10 minutes
- **0:20–0:60** — Build session: Students build their own agent
- **0:60–0:75** — Demo day: Each student/pair demos their agent (2–3 min each)

### The Build Challenge
Students choose one of three agent types to build:

**Option A — The Research Agent**  
Goal: Given any topic, the agent researches it, summarizes the key findings, and lists 3 questions still worth exploring.  
Suggested tools: web search, text summarization

**Option B — The Study Buddy Agent**  
Goal: Given a subject and a student's weak areas, the agent creates a personalized study plan with practice questions.  
Suggested tools: knowledge base (upload your own notes), question generation

**Option C — The Creative Agent**  
Goal: Given a genre, theme, and length, the agent writes a short story and then critiques its own writing.  
Suggested tools: writing, self-review

**Option D — The Community Impact Agent** ★ *(capstone track)*  
Goal: Pick a real problem in your school or community (food-drive logistics, a multilingual welcome guide for new students, a study-resource finder, a local-volunteering matcher) and build an agent that helps with it.  
Suggested tools: web search, knowledge base, summarization — plus a one-page **"agent policy"** the student writes: who it's for, what data it uses, where a human must approve, and what could go wrong.  
*This is the recommended track for students building a portfolio piece (see Capstone below) — they demo the build **and** the policy together.*

### Build Worksheet
```
Agent Name: _______________
What does it do (one sentence)? _______________
What tools did you give it? _______________
What is the most important instruction in its system prompt? _______________
Biggest failure you found while testing: _______________
How did you fix it (or how would you fix it)? _______________
One thing your agent does surprisingly well: _______________
One thing it still can't do: _______________
```

### Demo Day — The Three Accountability Questions
Every student must answer these three questions during their demo. They're not optional extra credit — they're part of the grade, and they make accountability a *presentation skill* (which is exactly what they'll need in college and on the job):

1. **What could go wrong?** — Name a realistic failure mode of your agent.
2. **Who is responsible if it fails?** — If someone relied on your agent and it gave bad output, who's accountable, and how would they catch it?
3. **What data did you use?** — What did your agent read or store, and is any of it sensitive?

This closes the loop opened in Week 1 ("Who owns this agent's decisions?"). Students who can build *and* answer these three questions are demonstrating the mindset real AI teams are hired for.

### Demo Day Rubric
| Criteria | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent completes its stated goal | Rarely | Sometimes | Consistently |
| Student can explain how it works | Vague | Partially | Clearly |
| Student identified at least one failure mode | No | Partially | Yes, with fix attempt |
| **Answers the 3 accountability questions** | Skips or can't answer | Answers some | Clear, thoughtful answers to all three |
| Presentation clarity | Hard to follow | Understandable | Clear and engaging |

### Teacher Notes
- Give students 5 minutes of "break it on purpose" time during testing — ask them to try to make their agent fail. This teaches adversarial thinking and builds intuition for robustness.
- Some agents will work well, some won't. That's the lesson. The post-build debrief is more important than the build itself.
- The three accountability questions reward thoughtfulness over polish — a modest agent with sharp answers should out-score a flashy one whose builder can't say what could go wrong.

## Week 6 — AI Safety, Ethics & Your Future

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify at least 4 things that can go wrong with AI agents
- Articulate the ethical responsibilities of AI builders
- Describe 3 career paths in AI and the skills they require

### Key Concepts
| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Hallucination | AI generating false information with high confidence |
| Bias | Systematic errors in AI output that reflect unfairness in training data |
| Prompt injection | An attack where malicious text tricks an AI agent into ignoring its instructions |
| Alignment | The challenge of making AI systems pursue the goals their builders actually intend |
| AI safety | The field of research dedicated to ensuring AI systems behave reliably and beneficially |
| Responsible AI | A set of principles (fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy) for ethical AI development |

### Lesson Outline (75 min)
- **0:00–0:15** — Review: What were the failure modes from Week 5 demo day? Categorize them on the board.
- **0:15–0:35** — Lecture: The 4 major risk categories in agentic AI (misinformation, bias, privacy, autonomy gone wrong). Real examples from deployed systems.
- **0:35–0:55** — Ethics Debate (below)
- **0:55–0:65** — Career landscape: AI Engineer, ML Engineer, AI Safety Researcher, Prompt Engineer, AI Ethics Officer — what each role does and what skills they need.
- **0:65–0:72** — Careers in Responsible AI (below)
- **0:72–0:75** — Final reflection

### The Ethics Debate
Split the class into three groups. Each group argues one position, then presents:

**Scenario:** A hospital wants to deploy an AI agent that can autonomously order medications for patients based on their symptoms and records. The agent would act without a doctor approving each order to reduce wait times.

- **Group A — Build it:** The benefits outweigh the risks. Present the case for deployment.
- **Group B — Don't build it:** The risks are too high. Present the case against.
- **Group C — Build it with constraints:** It's possible, but only with specific safeguards. Propose the safeguard system.

### Careers in Responsible AI (7 min)
The fastest-growing AI jobs aren't all "engineer." As AI gets deployed everywhere, organizations need people who make sure it's used *well* — and many of these roles value judgment, writing, and ethics over heavy coding. Share a few:

| Role | What they do | Strengths it rewards |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Policy Analyst** | Shapes the rules and laws for how AI can be used | Writing, civics, critical thinking |
| **AI Ethics Officer** | Sets a company's responsible-AI principles and reviews products against them | Ethics, communication, judgment |
| **AI Auditor** | Tests deployed AI systems for bias, safety, and compliance — like a financial auditor, but for algorithms | Detail, fairness, investigation |
| **AI Product Manager** | Decides what an AI product should and shouldn't do, and for whom | Empathy, prioritization, communication |
| **AI Trainer / Red-teamer** | Tries to break AI systems on purpose to find harms before users do | Creativity, adversarial thinking |

**Why this matters here:** these are on-ramps into AI for students who love writing, debate, law, art, or helping people — not only those who love code. **Who holds these roles shapes whose interests AI protects.** For students from under-resourced and Title I schools, representation in AI *leadership and oversight* is just as important as representation in engineering — and these paths are wide open right now.

### Final Reflection Worksheet
```
Complete these sentences:

The most surprising thing I learned in this course was _______________

An AI agent I would want to build someday is _______________

The most important question about AI that nobody seems to be asking is _______________

One thing builders of AI agents are responsible for is _______________

A career in AI that interests me is _______________ because _______________
```

### Teacher Notes
- The hospital debate generates strong opinions. Good. Let it run. Bring it back by asking: "Is there a version of this that all three groups could accept?"
- Career discussion: emphasize that AI careers are not just for coders. Ethics, law, communication, product design, and education are all critical fields right now.

## Capstone — Build + Policy (Portfolio Piece)

Students who choose **Option D — The Community Impact Agent** in Week 5 finish the course with a portfolio piece that shows *both* skills employers and admissions officers look for: the ability to **build** and the judgment to **govern**.

The capstone has two parts, presented together:
1. **The agent** — a working Community Impact Agent that helps with a real problem in their school or community.
2. **The one-page agent policy** — who it's for, what data it uses, where a human approves (the 🛑 checkpoints from Week 4), and answers to the three accountability questions from Week 5.

> **Why this is a strong college-application artifact:** most students can say "I used AI." Very few can say "I built an AI agent for my community, *and* I can explain what could go wrong, who's accountable, and how I protected people's data." That second sentence is the differentiator. Encourage students to keep their build worksheet, policy page, and a 60-second demo recording together as one portfolio entry.

---

## Equity & Access

This curriculum is for **every** classroom — including schools where logins are restricted, devices are shared, or tools are firewalled. Each tool-based activity has a lower-barrier path:

### No-login / no-account fallback
- **Teacher-projected mode:** The teacher runs the tool once on the projector and the class directs it together. Students complete the worksheet from the shared demo — no student accounts needed. Works for every activity in Weeks 2, 3, and 5.
- **Approved-tool check:** Before requiring any account, confirm the tool is on your district's approved list and meets your data/privacy rules (see the FERPA note in Week 1).

### Unplugged / offline alternatives
- **Week 3 (RAG), paper version:** Give each group a one-page "source document" and a set of questions. They may only answer using sentences highlighted in the document — and must cite the line. Asking a question the page can't answer = they must write "not in the source." This *is* RAG, by hand.
- **Week 4 (multi-agent):** Already unplugged — it's a paper pipeline-design activity.
- **Week 5 (build):** Students who can't access a builder can write a complete **agent spec** (goal, tools, system prompt, checkpoints, failure modes) on paper and "run" it as a role-play with a partner acting as the agent.

### Short on time? The 45-minute track
Every week compresses to ~45 minutes by trimming to the core:

| Week | 45-min core (keep) | Trim |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Loop lecture + Agent Hunt + accountability beat | Extended group exploration |
| 2 | LLM/hallucination lecture + 1 prompt round + Wrong-vs-Harmful 2×2 | Run only Round 1 of the challenge |
| 3 | RAG demo (Part A) + debrief | Skip Part B Memory Bot |
| 4 | Pipeline design + 🛑 checkpoint annotation | Shorten gallery walk |
| 5 | Build + demo with the 3 accountability questions | Reduce build time; demo in small groups |
| 6 | Risk lecture + ethics debate + Responsible-AI careers | Shorten final reflection to exit-ticket |

### Reduce blank-page anxiety — use worked examples
For each worksheet, project or hand out **one filled-in example** before students start their own (e.g., a completed Agent Profile for "Google Maps," a sample pipeline with checkpoints, a model agent policy). Seeing one finished example is the single biggest unblock for students who freeze on an empty form. Teachers can fill one in live in 2 minutes, or reuse a strong student example from a previous run.

---

## Portfolio Tracker

The course is designed so each week produces **one artifact**. Collected together, they tell a complete story — concept understanding, build skill, and responsible-AI judgment. Have students keep these in one folder (a doc, a slide deck, or the printable tracker):

| Week | Artifact | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Agent Profile (Agent Hunt) | Understands the Think → Act → Observe loop |
| 2 | Winning prompt + Wrong-vs-Harmful placement | Prompting skill + fact-checking judgment |
| 3 | RAG notebook screenshot with citations | Understands retrieval / grounding |
| 4 | Pipeline diagram with 🛑 checkpoints | Designs oversight into a system |
| 5 | Working agent + build worksheet | Can build and debug an agent |
